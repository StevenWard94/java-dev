 * WardDuplicate.java | Duplicate Project
 *
 * A program to validate a user-input array and output information about duplicate elements.
 * This program first prompts the user to enter the number of elements they intend to input. This
 * number is validated to ensure that it is greater than or equal to 15, and the program will prompt
 * the user for another number (this cycle is repeated until a valid number is given); from now on,
 * this number will be referred to as 'N'. Once the user has entered a legal value for N, he/she
 * will be prompted, one at a time, for N integer elements. Each element must be an integer value on
 * the interval, [1,N] (note: this range is inclusive), and if it is not, the user will be
 * prompted repeatedly until an acceptable value has been input. Once the array has been populated
 * with N valid elements, this program presents an output containing the following information:
 *     a) the array elements given by the user (i.e. "the array")
 *     b) the elements, if any, that were duplicated
 *     c) if there are duplicate values, those values and the number of times they were duplicated.
 * When the user closes this final output window, the program will terminate.
